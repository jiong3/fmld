## Features

- two interchangeable formats: human editable text and sqlite database
    - text format lives in the repository and is checked by the tool using github actions
    - sqlite is generated by the tool
- allows cross-references between words and definitions, e.g. for synonyms, antonyms, measure words, ...
- possibility to add additional information to words, definitions, cross-references and pronunciations:
    - notes with further explanations
    - any number of tags, e.g. to indicate relevance or highlight differences between usage in China and Taiwan
    - comments (meta information for editors or developers, not for users of the dictionary)
- constant, unique IDs for definitions and notes
    - internal and external links to definitions, e.g. to provide examples sentences for a specific definition
    - possibility to add (initially automatic) translations

## Documentation

- the text format is described in the header of dict/fmld.en.txt
- the sql schema is saved in rust/config.rs and docs/FMLD_drawdb.json (open with <https://drawdb.vercel.app/>)
- an sqlite sample file is available in the github releases
- currently supported tags and reference types can be found in rust/config.rs

## TODO

- come up with a better representation of the definition trees from wiktionary, currently elements are concatenated using ---
- semi-automatically:
    - add tags to distinguish Chinese and Taiwanese pronunciations
    - move some information in parentheses to tags: (chiefly Taiwan) --> t, (obsolete) --> x
    - some entries have a very large number of definitions which would need to be assigned a relevance class using tags
- characters all have the same class / part-of-speech label at the moment
- comparison to MDBG data
- add missing entries which are in vocabulary lists used by Chinese learners (e.g. HSK and TOCFL)
